        Hi! my name is Aland, I was born in Venezuela, I'm 33 year old, I'm pursuing a bachelors degree in Applied Technology because I love develop software,
        In my free time I like play the piano, reading a book and play with my kids. I was married in the Caracas Venezuela Temple with my lovely wife Adahannys, 
        and I've 2 beautiful children.

        Actually I'm working with Seminaries and Institutes of religion in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was born as a member
        of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am very excited to start a new phase of my life as an online student at BYU Idaho.
